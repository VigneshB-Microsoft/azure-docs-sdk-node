    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      Measures the angle between vectors to quantify their similarity,
      disregarding magnitude. The smaller the angle, the closer the similarity.
  - name: DotProduct
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.KnownVectorSearchAlgorithmMetric.DotProduct'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      Calculates the sum of element-wise products to gauge alignment and
      magnitude similarity. The larger and more positive, the closer the
      similarity.
  - name: Euclidean
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.KnownVectorSearchAlgorithmMetric.Euclidean'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      Computes the straight-line distance between vectors in a multi-dimensional
      space. The smaller the distance, the closer the similarity.
  - name: Hamming
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.KnownVectorSearchAlgorithmMetric.Hamming'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      Only applicable to bit-packed binary data types. Determines dissimilarity
      by counting differing positions in binary vectors. The fewer differences,
      the closer the similarity.
