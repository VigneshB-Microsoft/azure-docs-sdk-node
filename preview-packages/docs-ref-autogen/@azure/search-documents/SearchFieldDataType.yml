  ### Known values supported by the service:


  **Edm.String**: Indicates that a field contains a string.


  **Edm.Int32**: Indicates that a field contains a 32-bit signed integer.


  **Edm.Int64**: Indicates that a field contains a 64-bit signed integer.


  **Edm.Double**: Indicates that a field contains an IEEE double-precision
  floating point number.


  **Edm.Boolean**: Indicates that a field contains a Boolean value (true or
  false).


  **Edm.DateTimeOffset**: Indicates that a field contains a date/time value,
  including timezone

  information.


  **Edm.GeographyPoint**: Indicates that a field contains a geo-location in
