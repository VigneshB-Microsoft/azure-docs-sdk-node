  ### Known values supported by the service

  **scalarQuantization**: Scalar Quantization, a type of compression method. In
  scalar quantization, the original vectors values are compressed to a narrower
  type by discretizing and representing each component of a vector using a
  reduced set of quantized values, thereby reducing the overall data size. \

  **binaryQuantization**: Binary Quantization, a type of compression method. In
  binary quantization, the original vectors values are compressed to the
  narrower binary type by discretizing and representing each component of a
  vector using binary values, thereby reducing the overall data size.
