      The size of the dynamic list containing the nearest neighbors, which is
      used during index

      time. Increasing this parameter may improve index quality, at the expense
      of increased

      indexing time. At a certain point, increasing this parameter leads to
      diminishing returns.

      The size of the dynamic list containing the nearest neighbors, which is
      used during search

      time. Increasing this parameter may improve search results, at the expense
      of slower search.

      Increasing this parameter leads to diminishing returns.

    summary: >-
      The number of bi-directional links created for every new element during
      construction.

      Increasing this parameter value may improve recall and reduce retrieval
      times for datasets

      with high intrinsic dimensionality at the expense of increased memory
      consumption and longer

      indexing time.
